1. comission - **cap at 5%**, unless if highly ranked, then excusable to go over
   1. perhaps first do the matching on other paramters - then do a comission filter.
2. port_from - location example of unstandardized input. "East Med/ Black Sea range"
   1. consider either training GPT to be more standardized, OR manually sort out SEAS and stuff, based on substring matches ?
3. Extract more emails from GPT, but only from the **past week** or so, and use to train and run some matches.
